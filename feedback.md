#Project 2 Feedback

Congratulations on having completed project 2! I have provided you feedback in the form of a pullrequest, that you should not merge into your project. More detailed note of mine can be found throughout your projectâ€”run the command `rake notes` to see them.

## Rubric

### Criteria

* **Project WorkFlow**: Was the project planed thoroughly? Was it committed to frequently? Does it have a solid readme?
* **Technical Requirements**: Does the project meet the technical requirements in the project specs?
* **Creativity**: Is there a personal/creative touch in the project?
* **Code Quality**: Is the code well-named, DRY, commented, etc?
* **Problem Solving**: Was there an ability to break down a complex problem into smaller pieces and resourcefully solve each systematically?

### Possible Results

* Needs Improvement
* Complete
* Exceeded Expectations

## Evaluation

Areas for improvement:

* I don't see any edit or delete routes. It would be great to see you get practice with those actions.
* Avoid defining functions in your views. For example `users#show` should simply call a function that was already defined somewhere else, maybe in `main.js`. If so, then just pass the data that is coming from your rails controller to those defined javascript functions as arguments.
* Building a product that doesn't adhere to design patterns we covered in class ultimately proved challenging. I question if it was worth the effort, but I respect your ambition. Mixing ruby & javascript is challenging and that was not the point for this project.
* Take more time to plan and don't jump in to coding too quickly will allow you to make better design decisions from the get-go.

Keep doing:

* You demonstrated a lot of tenacity and drive during this project.
* The code that you did write in rails, for the most part follows best practices and is conventional.
* Nice job pushing your knowledge beyond your comfort zone with the integration of maps and a complex relationship like `attendances` among other things.

### Result: Complete
